* is created in the External Transactions table corresponding
* to one of the user's external accounts such as a bank
* account. 
*
* The integrator upon receiving notification of such a
* new withdrawal record performs some banking function to
* process the withdrawal, and then calls clearWithdrawal
* in order to finalize the withdrawal record in the Gateway.
